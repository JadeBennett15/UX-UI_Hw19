                <h1>Project Overview</h1>
                <p>Nowadays, people are too busy to make home-cooked meals in their households, so we decided to create an application that gives the user the convenience and variety of culturally diverse home-cooked meals, made fresh right in the safety of their own home. ChefMeet is an application that allows busy individuals, families, and people who are throwing parties to connect with a personal chef to meet their needs. The project’s purpose was to diminish unhealthy options that people choose, instead of cooking home-cooked meals due to their busy lifestyle. We wanted to create a way for people to have an active, healthy option while having the food fresh and ready for the individual(s) when desired.  </p>
                <p>Deliverables:
                    User Research

                    Wireframes for Prototype

                <h1>Roles & Responsibilities</h1>
                <p>The team included a total of 5 members. We had split the work up evenly and worked in smaller groups to get specific attributes completed. We all worked on the beginning process of the research together to make sure we were all on the same page before splitting off and conducting our interviews of users for the group's user research. We then came together to share what we had learned from the interviews and synthesized our data down. From that point, we split off into two groups again, a group of two, which I was apart of, and a group of three. We split up the work of mapping out our data based on the user research evenly between each group. When we got to the point of prototyping and wireframing, each member of the group created multiple wireframe pages of how they visualized the application to look. The group came together and chose components of each wireframe to make sure that those selected would be in the final prototype. We then split off into three groups to create an  A/B clickable prototype of the application. Two members worked on the main screens of prototype A, two members worked on the main screens of prototype B, and I was to create the displays that each prototype would include for the chef's profile page. We then conducted an A/B test on the prototype, and based on the feedback; we chose the more user-friendly option, still adding in some components from the other prototype that we thought would be important. From there, we worked on a hi-fi clickable prototype, putting the completed work together in a google slide presentation to share with the rest of the class.

                <p>
                    The initial process of User Research started with the User Research Plan. From there, all members worked to conduct a competitor analysis to understand what other applications are already on the market. We concluded that no separate app out there was like our own. All members came together to come up with a proto-persona, to understand who our intended audience would be. Two members of the group then came up with around 20+ interview questions, while the rest of us worked on creating survey questions and an Empathy Map that is based on the proto persona. Once completed, we were all to separate and conduct our interviews, using the interview questions. A member of our group, who was friends with a handful of personal chefs conducted interviews, so our group could understand the side of a private chef and the team of a user. After we did our meetings, we all worked together in Miro to perform a User Insight Analysis. After we each finished putting in our notes, we all worked together to sort the data into categories for the Affinity Map.

                    Based on our research, we had iterated our proto-persona into a User Persona. We have two user personas, one for the chef’s side as well as one for the individuals who use the application. Meet our personal chef Mia Ingram and our user Shruti Swenson.

                    To dive deeper into what users like Shruti Swenson would have wanted out of our application, a member of my group and I worked together to create an “I wish, I Like, What if” diagram. Based on that data of that diagram we reached out to the rest of our group to see what they deemed as most important and to ‘star’ those. My partner and I then went back and created a Priority Matrix to prioritize the needs of Shruti Swenson. The group then came together to create a Journey map for Shruti, and from the Journey Map, a member and I created a User Flow, while the rest of the three created a Storyboard of Shruti.

                    When it came time to create a design for the prototype, we decided to split off and design our paper prototype. When finished, we all shared the paper wireframes that we created, and all pointed out content that would be useful to use in the clickable prototype. Once we all decided on the usable content, the group split off once again to create an A/B clickable prototype that would be tested on users. Two members worked on the home pages of iteration A, two of the other members worked on the home pages of iteration B, while I designed the chef’s profile pages that would be used in each iteration. From there, each member tested both prototypes, conducted small interviews of what was liked and disliked. The group then came back together, sharing the information that was found. We decided on a prototype to go with and started to design a Hi-Fi clickable prototype based on the iteration that was chosen.

            <div class="conclusion in">
                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>During this case study, we have uncovered a massive demand to simplify cooking, grocery shopping, and meal prep. We believe this problem could easily be solved by allowing the busy professional to easily and efficiently search for a personal chef, based on their own preferences (reviews, price, dietary restrictions, and categories). Whilst being able to save your personalized filters, information, requirements, payment information all in ‘one’ app for future use.

                    Our research has also uncovered a large gap in existing apps and websites that have come up as a recurring problem for the users. The problem is there is no application out there that allows users to connect with personal chefs. It’s difficult to conduct an app that will solve this issue, without something to base our data on and making the app the best it can be. 
                     
                    Also, being able to allow the User to checkout securely/safely from the app, as well as having our users be comfortable with having a reliable personal chef cook their meals. The check out process would need to be secure for the user to feel safe. As for the chefs, we would need a strong amount of reviews and having a secure background check on the personal chefs to show that they are verified and reliable for use.
                    
                    ChefMeet will create a seamless and personalized meal planning experience without requiring any extra time or tedious planning from the user. ChefMeet will potentially make a profit from ads that will periodically show at login. Also, with a monthly fee for the subscribers to encourage the loyalty and longevity of the user. This will provide the User with exclusive offers and the best prices currently available. We would eventually like to add more filters to customize the user’s needs, to create an even more amazing user experience.
